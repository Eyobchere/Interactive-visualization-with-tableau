# interactive visualization of flight delay data with tableau
In this project, I designed explanatory visualization of flight delay data downloaded from BTS website (https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp) using Tableau. In the visualization, I showed that the major delay cause is arrival delay in USA aviation system. Even though flight delay depends on carrier and airport, it is found that the overall number of delayed flights is decreasing over time and more than 95 % of the flights were on time flights. From the evaluation of historical data, it is found that AA (American airline) has the most diverted flights at DFW and MQ has the most canceled flights at WQ airport whereas HA airline has the best performance in doing on time flights.
